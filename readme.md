###  Background

Pens & Printers is a national office supplies chain. They have just reported a 23% drop in revenue in the past year. At the moment, they send office supplies out of warehouses in four regions: East, West, South, and Central, and all four warehouses stock the same products. The Head of Sales thinks this leads to large amounts of unsold products in some locations.

### Task

The management at Pens & Printers would like you to look at the data and present to them the popularity of products in each region. Are there products that do not sell in some locations? Are there any other patterns over time in each region that you can find in the data?
